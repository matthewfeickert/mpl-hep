Making HEP (High-Energy Physics) domain-specific figures easily in matplotlib

.. inclusion-marker-1-5-do-not-remove

This package is currently a strawman, the roadmap consists of:
   1. Collecting a gallery of plotting examples, demonstrating common HEP use cases for matplotlib
   2. Identifying common usage patterns that would be better served by an interface package
   3. Establishing a specification document
   4. Writing an implementation
